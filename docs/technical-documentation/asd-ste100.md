**English is the global language for technical communication**. No matter where you work, most technical documentation is written in English or translated from it. If you work with an international team, you likely use English as your shared working language.

However, many readers of technical documentation are not native English speakers. Even in technical fields, relatively few professionals have **full working proficiency** (also known in Europe as C2 level).

If you work in a technical field, you know that clear and precise instructions reduce human error and risk. Operators must understand instructions without ambiguity. To meet this need, the **ASD-STE100 specification**, also known as **Simplified Technical English (STE)**, was created.

## A bit of history

In **the late 1970s**, the Association of European Airlines (AEA) asked the European Association of Aerospace Industries (AECMA) to review technical documentation in civil aviation. The goal was to make it easier to understand. The study concluded that the industry needed a simplified, controlled language.

The specification **first appeared in 1986** as the AECMA Document. It received its current name, the ASD Simplified Technical English Specification, **in 2005**. Since then, ATA Specification i2200 and ATA104 (Training) have required it. Defence projects, including land and sea vehicles, also require it. **The European Defence Standards Reference (EDSTAR) recommends it** as a best-practice standard for technical documentation.

Today, **STE is a requirement of the S1000D Specification**. Its use is also growing in engineering, translation, interpreting, and academia. The specification has evolved significantly since the 1980s. As of this writing, **Issue 9, published in January 2025, is the current standard**. Experts can submit a Change Form to help STE adapt to future needs.

**ASD, based in Brussels (Belgium), owns the STE Specification**, and the Simplified Technical English Maintenance Group (STEMG) maintains it.

## The basics

The STE Specification has **two main parts**:

- Writing rules that define grammar and style
- A controlled dictionary that lists approved general-use words for technical writers

### The rules

STE includes **53 writing rules** that define grammar and structure. Each rule includes explanations and examples. The rules distinguish between **procedural writing** (instructions) and **descriptive writing** (information).

There are **53 writing rules** which establish grammar and structure; all of them are illustrated with explanations and examples. These rules differentiate between **procedural writing** (instructions) and **descriptive writing** (giving information).

Some key rules are:

- **Write short and clear sentences** of up to 20 words for procedures and 25 words for descriptions.
- **Use vertical lists** to simplify complex information.
- **Write one instruction per sentence** to make task sequences easy to follow.
- **Focus each paragraph on one topic** so readers can find information quickly.
- **Limit paragraphs to six sentences** to keep the reader’s attention.

### The dictionary

The controlled dictionary includes **simple, familiar words**. Each word has **only one meaning and one approved part of speech**, which removes ambiguity. For example, writers can use “dim” as an adjective, but not as a verb.

The dictionary also lists **unapproved words**, along with **approved alternatives**. For example, writers should use “primary” instead of “main”, and “before” instead of “previous”. Writers must use verbs only in the forms shown in the dictionary.

> ✅ Technical writers can use company- or project-specific terms. These are known as **technical names** and **technical verbs**.</span>

> ⚠️ **STE and the Microsoft Writing Style Guide can conflict** at times. For example, STE rule 4.2 discourages contractions, while the Microsoft guide [recommends them](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/style-guide/word-choice/use-contractions) for a friendly tone. In these cases, writers must balance compliance requirements with context and audience needs.

## Benefits

The main goal of ASD-STE100 Simplified Technical English is **to make technical documents clear, simple, and unambiguous**.

STE also **supports translation.** Simple vocabulary and fixed grammar reduce variation between languages, which improves consistency.

✅ Use STE to:

- Improve technical document readability
- Reduce errors and misunderstandings
- Standardize terminology across industries
- Support clear communication and collaboration

❌ STE does **not** address:

- Abbreviations and nomenclatures
- Text formatting
- Units of measurement
- Oral communication
