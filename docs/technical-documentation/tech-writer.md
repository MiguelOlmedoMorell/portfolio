# Why your team needs a Technical Writer

Technical documentation can feel overwhelming. It exists to meet compliance requirements and help troubleshoot problems, but no one expects users to read it from start to finish.

That’s why good documentation must be easy to read, easy to scan, visually clear, and easy to find. When content is approachable, readers find and read what matters most.

Do any of these challenges sound familiar?

- Your team lacks time to write or update the documentation it needs.
- Your team struggles to write documentation that actually solves problems.
- Your documentation is hard to export or share, or worse: it creates security or privacy risks.
- People can’t find the documentation they need because it's in isolated silos, sometimes even offline.
- The same information exists in multiple places.

These problems are common, and they already have proven solutions. If managers or developers haven’t solved them, it’s not due to lack of skill or effort. It’s because documentation isn’t their primary role.

That’s where Technical Writers come in.

Writing documentation, organizing it, and making it easy to find require specialized skills, methods, and best practices. A common myth says that knowing English and being profficient with a technology is enough. The results of that belief are exactly the issues listed above.

By adding a Technical Writer to your team, you don’t just save time. You also avoid costly cleanups later, when documentation grows so confusing that you need external help to fix it.

So, what do Technical Writers bring to the table?

## Clarity

In technical documentation, even a small ambiguity can undo hours of work. Technical Writers create clear, concise instructions, ensure accessibility, mark sensitive content correctly, and avoid unnecessary jargon.

This isn’t just about knowing English. It’s about knowing how to present technical information so people understand it. Technical Writers adapt content to different audiences, adjusting tone, depth, and terminology as needed.

If you’re unsure how much clarity matters, consider this:

> “‘Anyone can write’. They sure can. Writing well is a different matter. So is writing well in a technical context. You were not hired because you can capitalise words and punctuate sentences correctly. You’re not copying and pasting what the engineers say and making it look nice. Your skill goes far beyond that”.

The more complex the topic, the greater the responsibility. Writing deserves the same care as engineering or design.

## Standards

Every profession follows standards, and documentation is no exception. To work well, it must be clear, consistent, and user-focused. That’s why Technical Writers rely on style guides, specifications, and industry standards.

Common style guides include:
- [Microsoft Writing Style Guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/style-guide/welcome/)
- [Apple Style Guide](https://support.apple.com/es-es/guide/applestyleguide/welcome/web)
- [Google developer documentation style guide](https://developers.google.com/style)

Some industries require controlled natural language, which reduces ambiguity and risk. One example is [ASD-STE100 Simplified Technical English (STE)](asd-ste100.md), widely used in aviation and increasingly adopted elsewhere.

You may also recognize ISO standards. In highly regulated fields such as medical devices, documentation must meet strict requirements. For example,  [ISO 13485](https://www.iso.org/standard/59752.html) and ISO [ISO 14971](https://www.iso.org/standard/72704.html) define rules for quality management and risk. Ignoring these standards can have serious consequences.

## Tools

Many teams include people who care deeply about documentation. They write thoughtful guides and training materials. Some may even discover that Technical Writing is their calling.

Yet something often feels off. Formatting breaks, images lack clarity, or translations miss context. Even strong writing can fail without the right tools.

Technical Writers know which tools support quality documentation. For example, visuals are key because people process images faster than text and remember them longer, according to [How People Learn](https://nap.nationalacademies.org/read/9853/chapter/8#124)

Writers use tools like Snagit or Lightshot to capture and annotate screenshots. They create diagrams with Visio or Edraw. They use whiteboards, mind maps, and version control systems like Git when compliance requires it.

They also rely on readability tools to measure how easy their text is to understand, and they know how to use platforms such as Confluence, SharePoint, or Notion effectively, rather than staying on the surface level.

The right tools turn good documentation into great documentation.

---

## Findability

Despite the job title, Technical Writers do much more than write. Making content easy to find is one of their most important responsibilities. If users can’t find the right document at the right time, the documentation fails.

Many companies struggle with this.

Technical Writers address findability through clear structure, consistent naming, and logical organization—often required for ISO compliance. They also use tags, metadata, internal links, and references to improve navigation.

They understand how platform search works. Some tools support natural-language search, while others rely on keywords or query syntax. Writers adjust structure and naming to match these behaviors and use features like favorites, related content, and recent updates to guide users.

---

## Versatility

Perhaps the greatest strength Technical Writers bring is versatility.

Some start as translators, editors, engineers, or designers. What they share is curiosity and a talent for learning complex topics and explaining them clearly.

They constantly learn new tools, technologies, and standards. More importantly, they translate that knowledge for any audience.

Developers and managers understand the product deeply. They don’t always have the time, skills, or desire to explain it clearly. Technical Writers bridge that gap.

---

## Conclusion

Technical Writers are as essential as developers, project managers, or product owners. Writing is a skill—especially in technical fields where mistakes affect users, safety, and compliance.

If you think your team doesn’t need one, look at how much time people spend writing, fixing, searching for, or rewriting documentation. Now imagine that work handled by a specialist.

The investment pays for itself.
