# How to choose the right documentation platform

Choosing where to store your documentation is a critical decision. The platform you choose directly affects how your team writes, organizes, and shares information, including formatting, navigation, extensibility, and folder structure. This choice shapes how your team collaborates every day, so it deserves careful thought.

You may have used Confluence, SharePoint, or even Microsoft Loop. Each platform takes a different approach to documentation. In this post, we compare their main strengths and limitations to help you choose the right one for your team.

## Key considerations

When choosing a documentation platform, focus on these factors:

- **Co-authoring:** Edit content in real time to take notes, fix errors, or capture meeting outcomes.
- **User permissions:** Control who can view or edit content to protect sensitive information.
- **Templates:** Use consistent layouts and styles to save time and improve quality.
- **Tool integration:** Connect with tools you already use, such as Single Sign-On or embedded apps.
- **Offline export:** Share documents outside the platform in formats like PDF or Word.
- **Folder structure:** Organize content clearly so users can find documents quickly. This may also support compliance requirements.
- **Ease of use:** A simple interface increases adoption across the team.
- **Search:** Find information quickly and accurately.
- **Storage:** Make sure the platform meets your file storage needs.
- **Flexibility:** Adapt the platform to different workflows.
- **Adoption and trust:** Widely used platforms often signal reliability.
- **Cost:** Choose an option that fits your budget.

### SharePoint

> “Organizations use Microsoft SharePoint to create websites. You can use it as a secure place to store, organize, share, and access information from any device”.
>
> — [What is SharePoint? – Microsoft Support](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/what-is-sharepoint-97b915e6-651b-43b2-827d-fb25777f446f)

#### Pros (SharePoint)

✅ **User permissions**

SharePoint provides strong access controls, including custom permissions for teams and projects.

✅ **Integration**

SharePoint works seamlessly with Microsoft 365 tools, including Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and OneNote.

✅ **Templates**

Teams can create site templates with reusable layouts and components.

✅ **Offline export**

Because SharePoint relies on Microsoft Office tools, exporting content preserves formatting.

✅ **Content structure**

SharePoint offers a traditional folder system, similar to Windows Explorer.

✅ **Cost**

SharePoint is included in most Microsoft 365 enterprise plans.

✅ **File storage**

Storage scales with licenses, includes version history, and supports large libraries.

✅ **Global recognition**

Over 53,000 companies use SharePoint worldwide. [Source](https://theirstack.com/en/technology/microsoft-sharepoint).

#### Cons (SharePoint)

❌ **Limited flexibility**

SharePoint relies heavily on external tools and technical setup, which can limit adaptability.

❌ **Poor search experience**
Content often becomes hard to find due to folder isolation and weak search results.

❌ **Usability challenges**

SharePoint is less intuitive, requires admin effort, and depends on familiarity with multiple Microsoft tools. According to a 2016 study, two-thirds of organizations using SharePoint reported low employee adoption due to its difficulty in use and understanding. [Source](https://www.colligo.com/media/document/Colligo-Gimmal-IW-SharePoint-Impact-2016.pdf).

❌ **Folder structure**

You cannot archive content directly. Teams must move old documents to separate sites.
